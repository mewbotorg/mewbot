# Why windows?

The aim of the mewbot project is to allow people to create chatbots with minimal coding experience.
Many of these people will be using a Windows environment.
As such it's vital that mewbot be wel supported on Windows.
Perhaps the only reliable way to do this is to do (some) of the dev on Windows.
If nothing else so the devs can notice and fix problems as they arise.

This guide will
 - walk you through setting up a Windows mewbot dev environment
 - instruct you in how to start contributing to the project
 - hopefully provide some useful troubleshooting tips for if your current dev environment has gone wrong

These instructions are intended for Windows 10 & Windows 11 only.

They should also work on Windows Server and Windows on Arm - but these have not been tested.

## What do I need to do before I start?

 - Ideally, you should be familiar with the basics of `python` programming
 - Likewise `git` - though a full introduction is beyond the scope of these docs
 - Backup your files.
 - Get a cup of tea

### Where can I learn about python?

There are many excellent courses online.
As a personal recommendation, you might want to try these courses

[Todo: Provide some courses]

### Where can I learn about git?

To contribute to mewbot, you don't need to know much git.
`pull`, `push` and `pull reqest` should cover you.

[Todo: Provide some sources]

### re. Backing up your files.

There is no one, perfect, dev environment.
Everyone is different, with different tastes.
As such, this guide aims to provide options - to allow you to build a dev environment which works will for you.
Some of these options involve registry edits.
Which may, in unlikely circumstances, damage your operating system.
Please do not take these measures unless you are prepared for this possibility.

## How to use these docs

This folder contains a series of numbered files.
Proceeding through them in order should yield a completed environment at the end of it.
Alternatively, if you are an experience dev, you can just read the quickstart guide.

If you run into any problems, we would be most grateful if you would append a summary of what went wrong and how you fixed it to the troubleshooting.md doc in this folder.

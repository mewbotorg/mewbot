## Safety notes

**Please be aware that a mistake in following these instructions _can_ produce a non-functional system.**

**Please do not proceed unless you are willing to risk having to re-install windows.**

Please back up your files before using any tools such as `regedit`.
These instructions do not guarantee you will have a working system at the end of this process! 

Remember to close all open terminals after making changes to Windows environment variables e.t.c.

No changes here should require a restart to take full effect, but it is often a useful first step to debugging a problem.

**DISCLAIMER**

We do not assume any responsibility for damage caused to your operating system, place of business, or other property from following these instructions.
Proceed at your own risk.

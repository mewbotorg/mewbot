## Safety notes

**Please be aware that a mistake in following these instructions _can_ produce a non-functional system.**

**Please do not proceed unless you are willing to risk having to re-install windows.**

Please back up your files before using any tools such as `regedit`.
These instructions do not guarantee you will have a working system at the end of this process! 
(Though you _probably_ will).

Remember to close all open terminals after making changes to Windows environment variables e.t.c.

No changes here should require a restart to take full effect, but it is often a useful first step to debugging a problem.

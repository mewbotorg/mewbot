# mewbot examples

One of the best ways to learn how to use a system is to have an example of that system in action.

E.g. There's a lot of variety in the IOConfigs written for mewbot.
Each of them comments to a different service, with different rules, quirks, and, mostly, different access methods.
As such, a working example is vital.
As is some documentation as to how you get that example up and running.

While this is true of framework plugins, it's also true of bot plugins.
An example showing what you've built in action is often really helpful when it comes to helping others get it up and running.
Or porting it to a different platform.

# tokens

Many of the services which mewbot connects to need tokens, or some equivalent, to run.

You should include some basic instructions as to how to generate these tokens with your plugin - even if it's just a link to the instructions provided with the api.

E.g. for how to run discord examples, please see `io-dev-notes/discord-dev-notes.md`

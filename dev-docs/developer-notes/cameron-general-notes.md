Standardization and upgrade run - next step

 - standardize all setter values to value
 - There's a few places - e.g. in FileSystem - where strings could be enums for clarity
 - And type(self).__name__ could be used in a bunch of different places to save on changes after a class rename
 - Consistent and present docstrings everywhere
